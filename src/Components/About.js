        <p id="text-about">
        Before deciding that I wanted to pursue coding as a career, I spent the last ten years leading financial and maintenance teams for a hospital group in Brazil. During this time, I gained a lot of professional experience that I have no doubt will help me to become a successful software engineer.

        I applied to study at Futureproof Bootcamp, and among more than 700 applicants, I got selected. The Bootcamp covered full-stack development and gave me the skills needed to start a career as a Junior Developer.
